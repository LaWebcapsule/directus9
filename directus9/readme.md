## Introduction

**Directus9 is a free and open-source data platform for headless content management**. It can be installed on top of any
new or existing SQL database, instantly providing a dynamic API (REST+GraphQL) and accompanying App for managing
content. Built entirely in TypeScript (in Node and Vue), Directus9 is completely modular and end-to-end extensible...
with absolutely no paywalls or artificial limitations.

Modern and intuitive, the Directus9 App enables no-code data discovery, allowing for even the most non-technical users to
view, author, and manage your raw database content. Our performant and flexible API is able to adapt to any relational
schema, and includes rule-based permissions, event/web hooks, custom endpoints, numerous auth options, configurable
storage adapters, and much more.

Current database support includes: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MS-SQL Server, OracleDB, MariaDB, and variants such as AWS
Aurora/Redshift or Google Cloud Platform SQL.
