# Headless CMS

> {{ $frontmatter.description }}

A Headless CMS provides a way of managing content for websites, mobile apps, and other digital applications. It
separates the content from the presentation layer, allowing developers to create the frontend of a website or app with
whatever technology they choose. With a Headless CMS, content can be created and managed in one place, and allows any
number of applications built upon that data.
