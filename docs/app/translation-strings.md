Throughout the Settings Module, you will notice certain input fields have a <span mi icon>translate</span> icon on them.
While can always type static text into these input fields, this <span mi icon>translate</span> icon indicates that you
have the option assign a Translation String. To assign a Translation String, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the input that you'd like to add a Translation String to.
2. There are two ways to assign a Translation String:
   - Click <span mi icon>translate</span> and a dropdown menu with all Translation Strings will appear.
   - Type `$t:translation-string-key` and hit enter.
3. Choose a Translation String key as desired.
4. Optional: Click to remove the Translation String.
5. Click <span mi btn>check</span> to confirm.

Your Translation String is set! Now the language-appropriate text will be shown based on the current language of the
app. There are two ways to change the app language. First, administrators can set the Project's
[default language](/configuration/project-settings#general). Second, Users can choose their own personal
[language preference](/app/user-directory#user-preferences). Also note that if a language is chosen for which there is
no Translation String, the translation key _(from step three)_ will be displayed instead.

dropdown menu to create a new Translation String on the fly.
