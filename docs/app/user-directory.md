# User Directory

> The User Directory is the management system for all Users within a Project. [Users](/getting-started/glossary#users)
> are the individual accounts for logging in to the App. Each User belongs to a [Role](/getting-started/glossary#roles)
> which defines its [Permissions](/getting-started/glossary#permissions).

:::tip Before You Begin

To use this Module effectively, you will need to understand
[Users, Roles and Permissions](/configuration/users-roles-permissions.md).

:::
-->

## How it Works

This Module is a management system that enables one to view, invite, create, edit, and delete Users and User
information. Users can be created directly in the app, or invited to join via email.

When a User is created, they must also be assigned a Role. This Role defines the User's data access permissions within
Directus. In other words, it determines what a User can see and do inside the app.

The User Directory is composed of two pages: The User Directory Page and the User Details Page. It has all the same
features and functionality as the [Content Module](/app/content/collections) such as manual and automatic sorting, batch
edit/delete/archive, import/export from files, etc.

## User Directory Page

The User Directory Page lists all Users in a Project, with a navigation that allows quick access to Users by Role. This
page has the same functionality as the [Collection Page](/app/content/collections).

- **Select All** — Selects all Users currently in queue.
- **Card Size** — Toggles size of User Displays.
- **Sort Field** — Selects Field used to Users by.
- **Sort Direction** — Toggles ascending & descending sort order.
- **Search** — Enables classic type-based searching.
- **Filter** — Enables advanced query-based search.
- <span mi btn sec>person_add</span> — [Invite people](/configuration/users-roles-permissions#inviting-a-user) to become
  Users via email.
- <span mi btn>add</span> — [Create User](/configuration/users-roles-permissions#creating-a-user) manually.

_The following are only visible once Users are selected._

- <span mi btn warn>edit</span> — Opens a User Details page to apply a single edit across multiple Users.
- **<span mi btn dngr>delete</span>** — Deletes one or more Users.

### Layout Options

The **Sidebar > Layout Options** _(denoted by <span mi icon>layers</span> when Sidebar is minimized)_ allows you to
adjust how Users are displayed on the User Directory. To learn more, see [Layouts](/app/layouts).

## User Details Page

A User's profile page can be accessed from the User Directory or by clicking the User Menu at the bottom of the
[Module Bar](/app/overview#_1-module-bar). The profile page has the same features and functionality as the
[Item Page](/app/content/items). Administrators can add and customize Fields under
[Settings > Data Model > Directus Users](/configuration/data-model), but the following are available by default.

- **First Name** — The given name.
- **Last Name** — The family/surname.

- **Avatar** — An image to represent the User.
- **Location** — The city, country, office, or branch name.
- **Title** — The professional staff title.
- **Description** — A free-form text description.
- **Tags** — Keywords for search-ability.

### User Preferences

- **Language** — The preferred App language/locale.
- **Theme** — Light or Dark mode (or based on system preferences).
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** — Configuration for MFA.
- **Email Notifications** — Receive emails for notifications.

### Admin Options

- **Status** — Sets User status as Draft, Invited, Active, Suspended, Archived.
- **Role** — Defines the User's Role.
- **Token** — Allows generating a static User access token.
- **Provider** — _read-only:_ SSO provider associated with User. See our built-in [SSO options](/self-hosted/sso).
- **External Identifier** — Displays external identifier generated by SSO provider.

### Read-only Info

Information in the Sidebar _(denoted by <span mi icon dark>info</span> when Sidebar is minimized)_ also includes the
following read-only details:

- **User Key** — The Primary Key of the User.
- **Last Page** — The last App page accessed by the User.
- **Last Access** — The timestamp of the User's last App or API action.
