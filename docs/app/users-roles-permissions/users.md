# Users

> Users represent the distinct people _(and entities)_ that interact with your project. Each user can be assigned a
> role, which defines a user's access permissions.

Within the Data Studio, the [User Directory](/app/user-directory.md) is the primary place to manage users. However,
certain controls are included in **Settings > Roles & Permissions > [Role]** as well, which is what the following
sections will focus on.
