## Collection Page

![Collection Overview](https://cdn.directus9.io/docs/v9/app-guide/content/content/content-20220415A/collection-page-20220415A.webp)

The Content Module consists of Collection Pages and Item Pages. Use the Navigation Bar on the left to move between
Collections. Each Collection Page displays all Items in its Collection and comes with highly configurable
[Layouts](/getting-started/glossary#layouts) for browsing, visualizing, and managing Items. The Page Header includes key
action buttons for sorting, searching, filtering, creating, editing, archiving, and deleting multiple Items. To learn
more, see our guide on the [Collection Page](/app/content/collections).

The Content module helps you manage Items. Collections are managed within the **Settings** menu, as these actions
results in changes to the data model. To learn more, see our guide on
[data model configuration](/configuration/data-model).

## Item Page

When you click an Item on the Collection page, its Item Page will open. The Item Page is a form that enables you to
view, edit or delete an Item and its field values. You can also comment on, share, archive, or revert an Item from this
form. To learn more, see our guide on the [Item Page](/app/content/items).

In any project, certain Collections will have limited access permissions. In some cases, you may need to share one of
the Items within the collection with an individual or group of individuals who don't yet have permission. In this case,
use Shares. Shares enable you to share an Item from a Collection with anyone, regardless of their permissions, and even
if they are not Users within the project. To learn more, see our guide on [Data Sharing](/app/content/shares).
