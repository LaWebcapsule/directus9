# Layouts

> Layouts are customized displays for viewing and interacting with the Items in a Collection. This makes working with
> specific types of data models, such as map locations or calendar events, a more human-friendly experience.

## What's a Layout?

Data models vary drastically in shape and purpose, from eCommerce platforms to IoT fleets and everything in between.
While excel-style data tables often closely resemble how the data is stored in the database, this is not always the most
human-friendly way to view the data. Layouts provide intuitive displays to view and interact with Items in a Collection.

## How it Works

To adjust an Item's Layout, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the [Content Module](/app/content) and select the desired Collection.
2. In the page Sidebar, click **"Layout Options"**.
3. Choose the desired Layout you want to use.
4. Customize the Layout as desired.

### Customization Controls

Customization controls can be found in the following three locations.

- **Layout Options** — Located in the Sidebar.
- **Subheader** — Located just below the Page Header and above the Page Area.
- **Page Area** — The center of the webpage, which displays all Items.

These controls typically fall into three general categories.

- **Styling and Formatting**\
  These are additional customizations to the way a Layout displays such as the size of each Item, how images are cropped,
  etc.

- **Field Values Displayed**\
  Most Layouts allow you to choose which Field Value(s) are used to represent each Item on the Collection Page. For example,
  with blog posts, it may be ideal to have the hero image, blog title, date, author, etc.

- **Manual and Automatic Sorting**\
  Certain Layouts may allow sorting Items by value in ascending and descending order, drag-and-drop repositioning of Items,
  etc.

### Key Takeaways

As you go through Layouts, it may be helpful to keep the following points in mind.

- **Layouts will not be universally usable for all Collections.**\
  Layouts are tailored to work with specific data-models. For example, in order to work properly, the Map Layout requires
  the Collection have a Map Field configured and the Calendar Layout requires the Collection have a datetime Field configured.

- **Controls are different for each Layout.**\
  Each Layout presents data differently, so certain customizations may not be functional with certain Layouts. For example,
  the Map Layout displays each Item as a pin on a map, so this Layout has no controls for sorting.

- **Controls for a Layout may be in different locations.**\
  Depending on the Layout, the same control may be under Layout Options in the sidebar, the subheader, or on the Page Area
  _(and Items themselves)_. For example, the Table Layout lets you set the Field Values displayed in the subheader while
  the Card Layout lets you set Field Values displayed in the Layout Options menu.

## Table Layout
