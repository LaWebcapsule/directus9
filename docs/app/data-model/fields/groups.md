# Groups

> Interfaces are how users interact with fields on the Item Detail page. These are the standard Groups interfaces.

- **Start**: `Start Open`, `Start Closed`

## Raw Group

Interface that groups multiple fields together, but always displays them.

Any fields that you add within a Group will also maintain that grouping throughout the App Studio in filters, dropdowns,
and more.
