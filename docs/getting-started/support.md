1. Ensure your server and database meet the [minimum requirements](/self-hosted/docker-guide.html#supported-databases).

3. Stop `CTRL+C` and restart the server `pnpmx db-studio start`.
4. Run the database migration script: `db-studio database migrate:latest`\
   _Note: backup your database first._
5. Disable any data-caching within your project.
6. Test any app issues with both browser extensions and caching disabled _(i.e. Incognito Mode)_.
7. Confirm the issue is not related to your own custom code.
