# Architecture

> DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) is a wrapper for both your database and file asset storage system.

At first glance, it may be tempting to think of DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) as an app-centric platform. But that's
not the case. The app is just a GUI powered by the API, which allows developers, business users, and data analysts equal
access to data and asset storage, all in one place.

Here's how the platform architecture breaks down.

## The Database

DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) is plug-and-play. Once linked, it doesn't _own_ your data or file assets, but it does
create about 20 new data tables which are required for platform operation. These tables do not intermingle with the rest
of your data, so you can remove DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) without a trace. You also have the freedom to access
the database with raw SQL queries, link up any other service to your database, and access your file assets with CLI
commands.

## Database Introspection

At the lowest layer, the platform introspects the database and abstracts away specific SQL details. Regardless of SQL
vendor you choose, the platform works seamlessly. Similarly, DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) syncs with your configured
file storage service, providing control over file assets.

## The Data Engine

The next layer contains logic to access, transmit, query, and transform data, including event triggers, data querying
operations, and file transformations _(like image cropping)_. After that, your data and assets get cached for efficient
user access.

## Access Control

DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) provides secure user access methods. Choose access token format and configure
authentication as desired. You can set SSO and allow login through Google, Facebook, etc.

## The API

Finally, a complete set of REST and GraphQL endpoints are generated dynamically, based on your data model as well as
your configured roles and associated access permissions.

The DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) JS-SDK is [available via NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/directus). You also
have access to two Command-Line Interfaces (CLI). One enables server-side actions relating to your on-prem instance,
like migrating the database or resetting a user. The other allows you to interact with a DB Studio (Formerly Directus
v9) instance as you would with an SDK.

## The Data Studio

The DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) Data Studio is a no-code dashboard that brings the whole team together.

- Build your data model and manage data, content, users, and file assets.
- Create roles and permissions for your users, with granular and conditional logic.
- Design flows for task automation and data processing with a low-code GUI.

## Open Source

DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) is 100% open-source, modular, and extensible, ensuring you will never hit a hard
feature ceiling within the platform. Built entirely in crispy clean Typescript, mostly on Node.js and Vue.js, you have
the power to add or modify _any feature_ with your own custom extensions.

## Versioning

DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9) follows a SemVer-like versioning structure, but it's important to note that it does not
follow SemVer precisely. For complex systems like DB Studio (Formerly Directus v9), SemVer doesn't really scale as any
tweak to any part of the codebase could be considered a breaking change for a fraction of use cases. We rely on an 80/20
approach to breaking changes: If the change affects the vast majority of users, it's a major breaking change. Otherwise,
we accept minor breaking changes as part of the minor release cycle.

`xx.xx.xx` -> `major.minor.patch`

- **Major** — A "big deal" release: _big breaking changes, big features, big re-designs._
- **Minor** — A new feature or meaningful improvement to an existing feature: _may or may not be breaking._
- **Patch** — Bugfixes and tweaks that are backwards compatible: _but no new features._
