# Migrate Your Data Model

Directus9' schema migration endpoints allow users to retrieve a project's data model and apply changes to another project.

This is useful if you make changes to a data model in a development project and need to apply them to a production project, or to move from a self-hosted project to Directus9 Cloud.
