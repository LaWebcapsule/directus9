# Collections

> Collections are the individual collections of items, similar to tables in a database. Changes to collections will
> alter the schema of the database. [Learn more about Collections](/getting-started/glossary#collections).

## The Collection Object

`collection` **string**\
Name of the collection. This matches the table name in the database.

#### Meta

Directus9 metadata, primarily used in the Admin App.

`collection` **string**\
Name of the collection. This matches the table name in the database.

`icon` **string**\
Icon displayed in the Admin App when working with this collection.

`note` **string**\
Short description displayed in the Admin App.

`display_template` **string**\
How items in this collection should be displayed when viewed relationally in the Admin App.

`hidden` **boolean**\
Whether or not this collection is hidden in the Admin App.

`singleton` **boolean**\
Whether or not this collection is treated as a singleton.

`translations` **array**\
How this collection's name is displayed in the different languages in the Admin App.

`archive_field` **string**\
What field in the collection holds the archived state.

`archive_value` **string**\
What value the archive field should be set to when archiving an item.

`unarchive_value` **string**\
What value the archive field should be set to when unarchiving an item.

`archive_app_filter` **boolean**\
Whether or not the Admin App should allow the user to view archived items.

`sort_field` **boolean**\
What field holds the sort value on the collection. The Admin App uses this to allow drag-and-drop manual sorting.

`accountability` **string**\
What data is tracked. One of `all`, `activity`. See [Accountability](/configuration/data-model#accountability) for more information.

`item_duplication_fields` **array**\
What fields are duplicated during "Save as copy" action of an item in this collection. See [Duplication](/configuration/data-model#duplication)
for more information.

`group` **string**\
The name of the parent collection. This is used in [grouping/nesting of collections](/configuration/data-model#sorting-grouping).

`sort` **number**\
What sort order of the collection relative to other collections of the same level. This is used in [sorting of collections](/configuration/data-model#sorting-grouping).

`collapse` **string**\
What is the default behavior of this collection or "folder" collection when it has nested collections. One of `open`, `closed`,
`locked`.

#### Schema

"Raw" database information. Based on the database vendor used, different information might be returned. The following
are available for all drivers.

`name` **string**\
The table name.

`comment` **string**\
The table comment.

#### Fields

This holds an array of initial fields used for the collection. You can use the same model as used in
[Fields](/reference/system/fields.html) to submit fields here. You can use this to set a custom primary key type as
well. If a primary key field is omitted, the request will auto-generate an auto-incremented primary key field named
`id`.

::: tip

["folder" collections do not hold any data](/configuration/data-model#sorting-grouping), hence their schema would be
`null`.

:::

```json
{
	"collection": "articles",
	"meta": {
		"collection": "articles",
		"icon": "article",
		"note": "Blog posts",
		"display_template": "{{ title }}",
		"hidden": false,
		"singleton": false,
		"translations": [
			{
				"language": "en-US",
				"translation": "Articles"
			},
			{
				"language": "nl-NL",
				"translation": "Artikelen"
			}
		],
		"archive_field": "status",
		"archive_value": "archived",
		"unarchive_value": "draft",
		"archive_app_filter": true,
		"sort_field": "sort",
		"item_duplication_fields": null,
		"sort": 1
	},
	"schema": {
		"name": "pages",
		"comment": null
	},
	"fields": [
		{
			"field": "title",
			"type": "string",
			"meta": {
				"icon": "title"
			},
			"schema": {
				"is_primary_key": true,
				"is_nullable": false
			}
		}
	]
}
