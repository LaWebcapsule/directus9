# Accessing Files

> Every file managed by the platform is uploaded to the configured storage adapter, and its associated metadata is
> tracked within the `directus_files` system collection. Any requested file transformations are handled on the fly, and
> are only saved to storage.

---

## Accessing a File

The location of your actual file originals is based on the project's configuration, but you can consistently access them
via the API using the following URL.

```
example.com/assets/<file-id>
example.com/assets/1ac73658-8b62-4dea-b6da-529fbc9d01a4
```

::: tip SEO

You can provide an optional filename after the UUID to optimize for SEO, for example:

```
example.com/assets/<file-id>/<filename>
example.com/assets/1ac73658-8b62-4dea-b6da-529fbc9d01a4/directus9-logo.png
```

This optional filename is also used in the Content-Disposition header when the `?download` query parameter is used.

:::

::: warning Direct File Access

While you may _technically_ be able to expose your storage adapters root file system and access your raw files through
there, it is recommended that you always use the Directus9 API. This is the only way that you can take advantage of file
permissions and other built-in features.

1800x1200_

---

## Downloading a File

To download an asset with the correct filename, you need to add the `?download` query parameter to the request and the
`download` attribute to your anchor tag. This will ensure the appropriate
[Content-Disposition](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html) headers are added. Without this, the
download will work on the _same_ domain, however it will have the file's "id" as the filename for cross-origin requests.

### Example

```html
<a href="https://your-directus9.com/assets/<file-id>?download" target="_blank" download="Your File.pdf">Download</a>
```

---

## Requesting a Thumbnail

Fetching thumbnails is as easy as adding a `key` query parameter to the original file's URL. In the Admin App, you can
configure different asset presets that control the output of any given image. If a requested thumbnail doesn't yet
exist, it is dynamically generated and immediately returned.

### Preset Transformations

- **`key`** — This **key** of the [Storage Asset Preset](/configuration/project-settings#files-thumbnails), a shortcut
  for the below parameters

### Custom Transformations

Alternatively, if you have "Storage Asset Transform" set to all, you can use the following parameters for more fine
grained control:

- **`fit`** — The **fit** of the thumbnail while always preserving the aspect ratio, can be any of the following
  options:
  - `cover` — Covers both width/height by cropping/clipping to fit
  - `contain` — Contain within both width/height using "letterboxing" as needed
  - `inside` — Resize to be as large as possible, ensuring dimensions are less than or equal to the requested width and
    height
  - `outside` — Resize to be as small as possible, ensuring dimensions are greater than or equal to the requested width
    and height
- **`width`** — The **width** of the thumbnail in pixels
- **`height`** — The **height** of the thumbnail in pixels
- **`quality`** — The optional **quality** of the thumbnail (`1` to `100`)
- **`withoutEnlargement`** — Disable image up-scaling
- **`format`** — What file format to return the thumbnail in. One of `auto`, `jpg`, `png`, `webp`, `tiff`
  - `auto` — Will try to format it in `webp` or `avif` if the browser supports it, otherwise it will fallback to `jpg`.

### Advanced Transformations

For even more advanced control over the file generation, Directus9 exposes
[the full `sharp` API](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-operation) through the `transforms` query parameter. This
parameter accepts a two-dimensional array with the format `[Operation, ...arguments]`.

<!-- ### Cover vs Contain

For easier comparison, both of the examples below were requested at `200` width, `200` height, and `75` quality. The
`cover` thumbnail forces the dimensions, trimming the outside edges as needed. The `contain` thumbnail always maintains
its aspect ratio, shrinking the image to fit _within_ the dimensions and adding "letterboxing" as needed.

| Cover                                                       | Contain                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Cover](../assets/200-200-cover-75.jpg)<br>_8KB • 200x200_ | ![Contain](../assets/200-200-contain-75.jpg)<br>_6KB • 200x133_ |

::: tip Aspect Ratio

Images are never stretched or distorted even when changing the aspect ratio.

::: -->

### Quality vs File Size

The quality parameter can be any integer from `0-100`. Qualities closer to `0` have lower file sizes, but also poor
image quality due to compression artifacts. Values closer to `100` have larger file sizes, but better image quality.
Below are four possible qualities (200x200 cover) to visually compare the balance between compression and file size.

| 25%                                                                                             | 50%                                                                                             | 75%                                                                                             | 100%                                                                                               |

SEARCH /files
```

[Learn more about SEARCH ->](/reference/introduction#search-http-method)

### GraphQL

```
POST /graphql/system
```

```graphql
type Query {
	files: [directus_files]
}
```

##### Example

```graphql
query {
	files {
		id
		filename_disk
	}
}
```

---

## Retrieve a File

Retrieve a single file by primary key.

### Query Parameters

Supports all [global query parameters](/reference/query).

### Returns

Returns a [file object](#the-file-object) if a valid primary key was provided.

### REST API

```
GET /files/:id
```

##### Example

```
GET /files/0fca80c4-d61c-4404-9fd7-6ba86b64154d
```

### GraphQL

```
POST /graphql/system
```

```graphql
type Query {
	files_by_id(id: ID!): directus_files
}
```

##### Example

```graphql
query {
	files_by_id(id: "0fca80c4-d61c-4404-9fd7-6ba86b64154d") {
		id
		filename_disk
	}
}
```

## Upload a File

Upload/create a new file.

To upload a file, use `multipart/form-data` as the encoding type. The file contents has to be provided in a part called
`file`. All other properties of [the file object](#the-file-object) can be provided as parts as well, except
`filename_disk` and `filename_download`.

Alternatively, you can use `application/json` with JSON request body to associate metadata to a file that already exists
in the storage. The `type` property will be required to specify the mimetype of that file.

::: tip Order Matters

Make sure to define the non-file properties _first_. This ensures that the file metadata is associated with the correct
file.

:::

You can upload multiple files at a time by repeating the payload with different contents, for example:

```
--__X_BOUNDARY__
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

Example
--__X_BOUNDARY__
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="paulo-silva-vSRgXtQuns8-unsplash.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

// binary data

--__X_BOUNDARY__
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

Another Title
--__X_BOUNDARY__
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="mae-mu-GFhqNX1gE9E-unsplash.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

// binary data
```

In JavaScript, this can be achieved using the native `FormData` class:

```js
import axios from 'axios';

const fileInput = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]');
const formData = new FormData();

formData.append('title', 'My First File');
formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);

await axios.post('/files', formData);
```

### Query Parameters

Supports all [global query parameters](/reference/query).

### Returns

Returns the [file object](#the-file-object) for the uploaded file, or an array of [file objects](#the-file-object) if
multiple files were uploaded at once.

```
POST /files
```

```
// Request

Content-Type: multipart/form-data; charset=utf-8; boundary=__X_BOUNDARY__
Content-Length: 3442422

--__X_BOUNDARY__
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="paulo-silva-vSRgXtQuns8-unsplash.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg
