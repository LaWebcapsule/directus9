# Authentication

> All data within the platform is private by default. The
> [public role](/configuration/users-roles-permissions#configure-permissions) can be configured to expose data without
> authentication, or you can pass an access token to the API to access private data.

## Access Tokens

There are two types of tokens that can be used to authenticate within Directus9.

**Temporary Token (JWT)** are returned by the [login](#login) endpoint/mutation. These tokens have a relatively short
expiration time, and are thus the most secure option to use. The tokens are returned with a `refresh_token` that can be
used to retrieve a new access token via the [refresh](#refresh) endpoint/mutation.

**Static Tokens** can be set for each platform user, and never expire. They are less secure, but quite useful for
server-to-server communication. They are saved as plain-text within `directus9_users.token`.

Once you have your access token, there are two ways to pass it to the API, via the `access_token` query parameter, or in
the request's Authorization Header.

### Query Parameter

```
?access_token=<token>
```

### Authorization Header

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
