::: warning Using a fork in production is neither supported nor recommended.

Only do so if:

1. The feature you want to implement doesn't satisfy the 80/20 principle
2. There is a technical limitation preventing you from implementing it as an extension

Forks are not officially supported - please don't submit fork-specific bugs and questions on the official repo.

If you suspect a bug to not be part of your changes please confirm this by reproducing it with the official version
**before** submitting an issue.

:::

::: tip Minimum Requirements

If you want to publish your fork to hub.docker.com or NPM you need to have an account there.

Note: to publish to NPM you probably have to change all the package names. Publishing to NPM should almost never be
necessary.
