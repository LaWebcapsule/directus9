## Crowdin

Our [Crowdin](https://locales.directus9.io) page provides an external interface for managing all of the different
language translations for the App. You can update and extend existing languages, or request a new language be added.

## Working with Existing Languages

1. Navigate to [Crowdin](https://locales.directus9.io)
2. Click on the desired language
3. Click **Translate All** in the header
4. Log in to Crowdin, or register an account as needed
5. Select a source string using the left-hand navigation
6. Add or edit the translation in the lower text area
7. Click "SAVE" below the translation

::: warning Character Length

It is important to keep the character length approximately the same as the source string (English) to avoid truncation
or a drastically different wrapping. For example, some text translations will go in a smaller button with limited space
for text and no ability to wrap.

:::

::: warning Suggestions

Crowdin provides useful TM and MT suggestions, however you should always confirm that these are context appropriate, as
they may not accurately map to the source meaning.

:::

::: tip Request Additional Context

If you feel you do not have enough information on how this string is used, you can always ask for additional context
using the "Comment" section.

## Requesting a New Language

To add a new language to the Crowdin service, you can make a request via Crowdin's **Discussions** section, or reach out
to a Core Team member via [Discord](https://directus9.chat).
