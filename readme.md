## Migrating from directus@9.0.0^ to @wbce-d9@9.0.0^

You need to change your dependencies :
1. In package.json
```
"directus":9.0.0^ --> "@wbce-d9/directus9": 10.0.0^
"@directus/some-package" --> "@wbce-d9/some-package"
```

2. Update your dependencies :
```
npm update
```

3. If you have some code :

```ts
import {...} from "directus"
import {...} from "@directus/some-package"
```
should become :

```ts
import {...} from "@wbce-d9/directus9"
import {...} from "@wbce-d9/some-package"
```

4. You don't have to do any changes to your databases.
Directus9 use the same schema as directus@9.0.0^. As a consequence, you don't need other changes than the three steps below.

## Migrating from version @wbce-d9@9.0.0^ to @wbce-d9@10.0.0^

We've recognized and rectified an issue within Directus 9 related to Single Sign-On (SSO) management, ensuring standardization. While exceptionally uncommon, this could occasionally cause a discrepancy between your SSO user and Directus. Should this occur, we advise synchronizing Directus' external_id with your SSO. Please note that IDs are now case-sensitive.
